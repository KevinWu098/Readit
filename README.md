# Readit

A simple Google Chrome Extension that grabs your [favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/), but [now privated](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/business/media/reddit-moderators-api-protest.html), Reddit content from the WaybackMachine.

## Features
Simply install the extension and when it detects a private subreddit, it calls the Wayback Machien API to nab a pre-private snapshot for your viewing convenience.
